# PDF-merger

This merger helps you merge "all" PDF files in your folder into one file.

# It also can help you check:

1. if the user-entered folder exists in current directory
2. if any pdf files exist in the folder
3. if new file name already exists in the folder
4. if the entered new file name is valid
